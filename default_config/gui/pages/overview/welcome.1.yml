    text: 'Before data can be displayed here or used in a rule, a sensor has to be
      created through the <a href=''#house_admin/sensors''>SENSORS</a> menu item on
      the left.<br>A sensor in eGeoffrey is a logical container of one or more values:
      it can hold just a single piece of data or a timeseries. Sensor''s values can
      come from an associated service (e.g. a url with an image, a command to run,
      etc.), from actions associated to rules or from your interaction with widgets
      on this interface.<br>Once a sensor is created and data starts to get in, you
      can create a custom page to present values in many ways in this interface (see
      the <a href=''#examples/widgets''>Widget Showcase</a> page for examples).<br>Live
      interaction is also supported thorugh your personal housebot who will take care
      of your house on your behalf. No need to configure anything, based on the rules
      and sensors you have configured the housebot will be able to answer any question
      you could have! The same level of interaction is also possible through Slack
      when you are away from Home.'
